D3BulletCharts - QlikView Extension
===

D3BulletCharts is a QlikView object extension based on the famous [D3 JavaScript charting](http://d3js.org/) library.


Motivation
---------------
If you install QlikView you'll find an extension example called "bullet" with a basic implementation to integrate bullet charts in QlikView.

While this kind of visualization (based on a concept created by Stephen Few) is quite famous this extension here offers some more functionality based on a piece of code I have found on [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4061961).
